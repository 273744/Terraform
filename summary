Summary of Actions Taken and Current Progress:

Issue Overview:
After upgrading the machine type, the application stopped functioning as expected. Attempts to restore the machine to a previous state were unsuccessful due to issues with Rubrik's USM team.

Steps Taken:

Engaged the Rubrik vendor to assist with restoration, but the issue remained unresolved.
Engaged the Alation vendor to restore the application using available backups.
Attempted a destructive restore, which ran for approximately 4 hours but was unsuccessful.
Conducted a manual restore on Sunday, which took around 6 hours but did not fully recover the application.
Current Status:

The application is still not fully operational.
A troubleshooting meeting is scheduled for Monday at 12 AM to further investigate and resolve the issue.
Next Steps:

Collaborate with the vendors and technical teams during the scheduled meeting to identify and fix the root cause.
Provide updates to the business as progress is made.
Let me know if you need further refinements!
