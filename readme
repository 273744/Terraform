Step 1: Create a Terraform Configuration Directory Structure

Create a directory structure for your Terraform configuration:

css
Copy code
my-service-account/
  ├── main.tf
  ├── variables.tf
  ├── outputs.tf
  └── terraform.tfvars
Step 2: Write Terraform Configuration

Create a main.tf file with the following content:
hcl
Copy code
provider "google" {
  credentials = file(var.gcp_credentials_file)
  project     = var.gcp_project_id
  region      = var.gcp_region
}

resource "google_service_account" "my_service_account" {
  account_id   = var.service_account_name
  display_name = var.service_account_display_name
}

resource "google_service_account_key" "my_service_account_key" {
  service_account_id = google_service_account.my_service_account.name
}

output "key_secret" {
  value = google_service_account_key.my_service_account_key.private_key
}
Create a variables.tf file with the following content:
hcl
Copy code
variable "gcp_credentials_file" {
  description = "Path to the GCP credentials JSON file."
}

variable "gcp_project_id" {
  description = "Google Cloud Project ID."
}

variable "gcp_region" {
  description = "GCP region to use for resources."
  default     = "us-central1"
}

variable "service_account_name" {
  description = "Name of the service account to create."
}

variable "service_account_display_name" {
  description = "Display name of the service account."
}
Create an outputs.tf file to define any output variables you might need in the future:
hcl
Copy code
output "service_account_email" {
  value = google_service_account.my_service_account.email
}

output "key_secret" {
  value = google_service_account_key.my_service_account_key.private_key
}
Step 3: Create a terraform.tfvars file to provide values for your variables:

hcl
Copy code
gcp_credentials_file      = "path/to/your/credentials.json"
gcp_project_id            = "your-project-id"
service_account_name      = "my-service-account"
service_account_display_name = "My Service Account"
Replace the placeholders with your actual values.

Step 4: Initialize Terraform

Open your terminal, navigate to the my-service-account directory, and run:

sh
Copy code
terraform init
Step 5: Plan and Apply the Configuration

Run the following commands:

sh
Copy code
terraform plan
terraform apply
Terraform will show you what resources will be created or modified. If everything looks good, confirm by typing yes when prompted.

Step 6: Retrieve the Service Account Key

After Terraform completes the creation, you can retrieve the private key for the service account by running:

sh
Copy code
terraform output key_secret > my-service-account-key.json
This command saves the private key to a JSON file named my-service-account-key.json. Be sure to securely store and manage this key because it won't be retrievable again.

You have now created a service account and generated a key for it using Terraform in GCP while using a variables.tf file.
