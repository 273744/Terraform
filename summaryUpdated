Summary for Business Communication
Problem Statement:
After upgrading the machine type, the application stopped functioning as expected. Attempts to restore the machine to a previous state were unsuccessful due to missing permissions for Rubrik's USM team, resulting in service disruptions.

Actions Taken:
Engaged the Rubrik vendor to assist with restoration, but the issue remained unresolved.
Engaged the Alation vendor to restore the application using available backups.
Attempted a destructive restore on Sunday, which ran for 4 hours but was unsuccessful.
Conducted a manual restore on Sunday, which took 6 hours but did not fully recover the application.
On Monday, worked with the vendor to run a destructive restore using the May 8th backup. The restore was successful, and the core functionality was restored.
The index rebuild script is still running due to the large size of the data.
Current Status:
The DataNav application is operational, and all users can log in without any issues.
The index rebuild script is in progress and expected to complete soon.
Vendors have recommended stopping the Alation services in both Application and Analytics services to prevent similar issues in the future.
Preventive Measures:
Ensure the USM team has the necessary permissions to restore the server in case of future issues to avoid delays.
Engage vendors during machine upgrades to mitigate risks associated with machine type changes.
